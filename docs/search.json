      "contents": "\nI am a conservation biologist, currently pursuing a Master’s degree at the Bren school at UCSB.\nA little bit about my academic and career history:\nI graduated Magna Cum Laude from UC Davis in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology and a focus in Wildlife Health. During my undergraduate career, I worked at the UC Davis Road Ecology Center under Dr. Fraser Shilling studying the efficacy of wildlife crossing structures under freeways. In that time, I was listed as a contributor in the published findings for the project and was granted a research fellowship from the National Center for Sustainable Transportation. I also designed two independent research projects in 2018 and 2019 and presented my findings at the UC Davis Undergraduate Research Conference.\nAfter graduating, I worked with several environmental consulting firms providing biological monitoring for construction and mitigation activities in the Bay Area and wildfire remediation in Big Basin State Forest. I also have extensive field experience, including fieldwork abroad at the Jaguar Conservation Fund in Brazil and the Ann Van Dyk Cheetah Center in South Africa.\nMy interests and what I do now:\nI have primarily tackled problems at the interface of humans and wildlife, focusing on habitat connectivity and reduction of human-wildlife conflict. I am currently specializing in Conservation Planning at the Bren School, and have proposed a project working with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to examine how climate change and urbanization are affecting conflict with black bears.\nI hope to continue advancing the peaceful coexistence of humans and wildlife by promoting sustainable development, reducing human-wildlife conflict, and ensuring habitat connectivity in an ever-developing world.\n\n\n\n",
